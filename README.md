*SPRINT 2*
In the code file, all files than contain "boilerplate" in their name are just results from experimenting with the given boilerplates. All the "button" files concern the web extension, starting at version 0 to 4(latest version). Both "htmlCSS" were small experiments with creating a trashy web page(were not shown on the presentation day), with version 2 being linked to the web extension topic. 

Screenshots are all from the CSS boilerplate experiments, except for the last one from the 16th of May(web extension).
